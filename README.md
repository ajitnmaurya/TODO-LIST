# Todo

A simple todo application

Main Features and Functionality:

Adding a Task:
Users can add new tasks to their TODO list using the "Add Task" option. They are prompted to enter the task description. The program assigns a task number to each new task and appends it to the "tasks.dat" file.

Viewing Tasks:
The "Show Tasks" option displays the list of tasks along with their task numbers and completion status. Tasks are read from the "tasks.dat" file and displayed on the screen.

Managing Tasks:
In the "Manage Tasks" section, users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete. They can toggle the completion status of a task by entering its task number. Completed tasks are marked with a checkmark ([âœ“]).

Removing Tasks:
The "Remove Tasks" option provides the flexibility to remove tasks from the list. Users can choose to remove completed tasks, specific tasks, or even clear the entire task list. Tasks are removed by updating the "tasks.dat" file.

Exiting the Application:
The "Exit" option allows users to gracefully exit the TODO list application.

File Handling:

Your project uses file handling to store and manage tasks. It uses the "tasks.dat" file to store task information. The file is binary and stores instances of the todo class. The task's completion status is represented by the check attribute.

User Interface:

The application presents a clean and simple user interface. Users navigate through the menu by selecting options (1-5) to perform different actions. Each menu option corresponds to a specific task management feature.

Error Handling:

Your code handles errors such as file opening failures and invalid user inputs. It provides feedback to users in case of invalid choices and guides them on using the application correctly.

Conclusion:

In summary, your TODO list project in C++ offers users a command-line interface to manage their tasks efficiently. It provides the ability to add, view, modify, and remove tasks, all while maintaining their completion status. The project leverages file handling and offers a convenient tool for personal task organization and management.
